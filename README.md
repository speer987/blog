Welcome to my blog, which is hosted on Firebase!

**Link to my Web App: [here](https://blog-e59ab.web.app)**

People who worked on this project: Saarah Peer

This blog includes features such as:

- Uses a background image in the body of the app.
- Has a professional layout using grid.
- Is responsive, because it looks similar when windows are different sizes.
- Is visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing due to the fact that grid layout was used with colors that complement each other and an image that matches the colors was placed in the background of the posts.
- Is in a GitHub repo called blog, which describes the project.
- Does not include a prettierrc.json file, since Prettier was enabled in the VSCode IDE as an extension, so it automatically formatted files when I saved them.
- Has a detailed README.md file that contains my name and a link to where it is hosted on Firebase hosting right [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/blog-e59ab/overview).
- Formatted date so that you can see when the article was posted in readable time once you post it.
- Post body was written using a Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum generator, which can be found [here](https://www.bobrosslipsum.com/).
- Is built from code that was formatted.
- Was run through an HTML and an accessibility validator
- The app is hosted [here](https://blog-e59ab.web.app).
