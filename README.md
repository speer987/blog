# My Blog for CMSI 2021

Welcome to my blog!

<DESCRIPTION ABOUT BLOG>

This blog includes features such as:

- Uses a gradient in the center panel of the blog where blog posts are displayed.
- Has a professional layout using grid.

### Is responsive, because it looks similar when windows are different sizes.

- Is visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing due to the fact that grid layout was used with colors that complement each other.
- Is in a GitHub repo called blog, which describes the project.
- Does not include a prettierrc.json file, since Prettier was enabled in the VSCode IDE as an extension, so it automatically formatted files when I saved them.

### Has a detailed README.md file that contains my name, since I was the only person who worked on this project, and a link to where it is hosted on Firebase hosting:

Is built from code that was formatted.

### Was run through an HTML and an accessibility validator
